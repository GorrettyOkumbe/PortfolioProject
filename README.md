Introduction [our inspiration story]
I am an online ecomerence store built for the supply of hardware tools.

I was created to be used by: 
Three Developers:
1. Mary Okumbe
2. Careen Naitore
3. Rony opunga

The hardware store is meant to serve clients with difficulty in accessing physical stores.
The individual can be able to access the good at the comfort of their homes.
Also, the client can be able to access a variety of hardware tools in a one stop shop.
Which will save them time and money.
Thus I am also called CRM hardware online store.
